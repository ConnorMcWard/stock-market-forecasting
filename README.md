## Overview

This project is a multipart project aimed at enhancing my skills in machine learning and data science by predicting the top-performing stocks on a daily/weekly basis. I will develop 2 models (LSTM and RNN)

## Project Components

- **Data Ingestion:**
  - Real-time streaming of stock data from APIs (e.g. Yahoo Finance).

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Implementation of LSTM and RNN models in TensorFlow/Keras to forecast stock trends.

- **Visualization Dashboard:**
  - A web interface built with Plotly Dash to showcase real-time predictions, trends, and performance metrics.

## Future Goals

### Containerization
- Fully dockerize all components to allow seamless deployment across different environments.
- Dockerize individual components (data ingestion, ML pipeline, dashboard) for reproducibility and ease of deployment.
- Integrate components using Docker Compose to manage multi-container setups.

### Continuous Training
- Update models using both historical and live data to ensure accurate predictions.

### Data Preprocessing
- Utilize PySpark to handle high-frequency updates efficiently.

### Interactive Visualizations
- Develop dynamic visualizations that update as new data is ingested and processed.

### Optimization and Additional Features
- Optimize ML models and data pipelines for scalability and lower latency.
- Explore additional features such as alerts for significant market events or trends.

## Installation
- Installation instructions coming soon.
